  <p> <strong> WEB </strong></p>
 <p> The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, was originally a hypertext document management system accessed over the Internet. It has since evolved into the world's dominant software platform.</p>
 <p>The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>
